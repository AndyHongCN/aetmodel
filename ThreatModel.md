Documentation of threat model


## System Model 

The **system model** describes the high level view of the system and the context in which it is used. 
It abstracts the details and allows to define the trust boundaries and state changes relevant to security.

We adopt the STRIDE model to threat modelling: 
* Spoofing,	
* Tampering,	
* RepudiaLon,	
* InformaLon	
* Disclosure,	
* Denial	of	Service,	
* ElevaLon	of	Privilege
